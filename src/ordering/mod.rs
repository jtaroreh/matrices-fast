//!
//! Fill-reducing ordering. Contract (frozen):
//!   `pub fn order(pattern: &Pattern) -> Vec<usize>`
//! Returns `perm[k]` = the original index eliminated k-th; the result must be a
//! bijection of `0..n`, deterministic (the harness runs `order()` twice and
//! requires identical output), and return within the 2 s/matrix cap.
//!
//! ## Approach: per-matrix best-of over the ordering family, floored by the
//! ## grader's OWN baseline
//!
//! The score is a geomean of per-matrix `flops(yours)/flops(AMD)` ratios, so
//! choosing, *per matrix*, the cheapest of several candidate orderings can only
//! match or beat AMD — free headroom — **but only if the candidate set actually
//! contains the grader's baseline ordering**. The grader's baseline is
//! `feral_amd::amd_order` with LIBRARY-DEFAULT options (`aggressive = true`,
//! `dense_alpha = 10.0`), so we anchor on it: it is the guaranteed floor
//! (`ratio ≤ 1.0` on every matrix), the always-valid fallback, and — being the
//! baseline — it cannot itself time out.
//!
//! ## Where the headroom is
//!
//! 122 of the 300 dev matrices are STILL TIED at exactly 1.000 — AMD beats every
//! separator-, profile- and bandwidth-based candidate on them (60 in `lt_1k`, 40
//! in `1k_10k`, 22 in `gt_10k`). Each tie is pure upside. Note the leverage is
//! very uneven: `gt_10k` carries weight 0.40 over only 45 matrices, so one large
//! matrix is worth ~4.4 small ones — but it is also where the time cap bites
//! hardest.
//!
//! ## The timing fact that bounds every change here
//!
//! MEASURED with the test-only `probe` module (the harness prints `(capped)`
//! instead of a time, so this is otherwise invisible). Two runs of the SAME
//! probe on the SAME code, hours apart:
//!
//! | matrix            | run A   | run B   |
//! |-------------------|---------|---------|
//! | worst overall     | 1.019 s | 0.803 s (`arki0016`) |
//! | `crudeoil_lee4_10`| 1.019 s | 0.646 s |
//! | `nuclear10a`      |    —    | 0.412 s |
//!
//! **These numbers carry ~1.6× run-to-run variance from machine load, so the
//! local worst case is known to about ONE significant figure.** Treat any timing
//! written here as an order of magnitude, and re-measure rather than trusting
//! it — two earlier revisions of this header were wrong by 3× and by 1.6×.
//!
//! A previous revision also claimed "the grader is ~3-5× slower than local, so
//! worst-case LOCAL time must stay well under ~0.35 s". That cannot be right as
//! stated: the revision carrying a 1.019 s local worst PASSED the grader, which
//! it could not have done at 3-5× against a 2 s SIGKILL. We have no calibration
//! of grader speed. The defensible rule is therefore comparative rather than
//! absolute: **keep the worst local `order()` at or below the worst case of a
//! revision already known to have passed** (1.019 s).
//!
//! The cost driver is nnz, NOT n: `qapw` (n=705, nnz=87496) costs 0.539 s, more
//! than matrices 300× larger. Gate by nnz first, with an `n` cap as backstop.
//!
//! ## What this revision adds: RELABELLED-AMF MULTI-START (a SECOND lottery)
//!
//! Score 0.876925 → **0.871827** on the 300-matrix dev corpus; 36 matrices
//! better, **0 worse**, wins in all three size buckets.
//!
//! The relabel trick below had only ever been pointed at AMD (minimum DEGREE).
//! AMF (approximate minimum FILL) reads the vertex numbering the same way, so
//! `AMF(Q A Qᵀ)` composed back through `Q` is a randomized-restart minimum-FILL
//! ordering for the cost of one AMF pass. Why that beats spending the same time on
//! more AMD restarts: within one objective the draws are effectively i.i.d. and
//! saturate (see the budget table on [`RELABEL_BUDGET`]), whereas min-fill and
//! min-degree disagree about which vertex to eliminate — so AMF draws are not
//! redundant AMD draws. The wins duly land where min-degree had already converged
//! (`mpbp_15` 0.9951→0.8198; `pooling_haverly1pq` an exact 1.0000→0.9782 at n=31).
//! Gated on nnz (AMF's own cost driver), routed through the best-of floor so score
//! risk is structurally zero. See `memory/experiments/0005-*.md`.
//!
//! The generalisation, which is the part worth carrying forward: **any ordering
//! routine whose output depends on the input numbering becomes a randomized-restart
//! algorithm under `relabel`, for free.** RCM, Sloan, the ND separator choices and
//! MinFill are all still un-relabelled.
//!
//! ## The revision before that: RELABELLED-AMD MULTI-START
//!
//! Score 0.883906 → **0.876925** on the 300-matrix dev corpus, the largest
//! single gain measured on this problem so far (the previous revision's entire
//! 12-variant partitioner sweep bought 0.0042; this buys 0.0070).
//!
//! AMD's tie-breaking reads the vertex NUMBERING, so `AMD(Q A Qᵀ)` composed back
//! through `Q` is a genuinely different minimum-degree ordering for the cost of
//! one AMD pass. That matters because 122 of 300 matrices were tied at exactly
//! 1.000 — on those AMD beat every separator-, profile- and bandwidth-based
//! candidate, and a different AMD is the only family that can move them. 41 of
//! 300 matrices improve, against 7 of 260 for the whole partitioner sweep.
//!
//! Restart count is set by a per-matrix TIME BUDGET (`RELABEL_BUDGET / nnz`),
//! not a flat count — a flat 24 restarts costs 1.444 s on `nuclear10a` alone and
//! would breach the cap. The budget doubles as the gate, so this candidate needs
//! no `(n, nnz)` cutoff of its own. Worst combined `order()` is 0.978 s, below
//! the 1.019 s of the last revision that passed the grader. See
//! [`RELABEL_BUDGET`] for the cost model and the measured budget/cap sweep.
//!
//! ## What an earlier revision added
//!
//! Confined to the AMD-speed SMALL region (`n < 3000`, `nnz < 12000`):
//!   - **MINIMUM-FILL (minimum-deficiency / MinFill) ordering (pure Rust)** — a
//!     genuinely DIFFERENT greedy elimination heuristic from everything already
//!     present. Minimum-degree (AMD/AMF) eliminates the vertex of smallest
//!     *degree*; MinFill instead eliminates, at every step, the vertex whose
//!     elimination introduces the FEWEST NEW FILL EDGES — i.e. it minimizes the
//!     local *deficiency* (`#pairs of neighbors that are not yet adjacent`)
//!     rather than the degree. This is the classic min-deficiency criterion and
//!     it is orthogonal to the degree, bandwidth, profile and separator families
//!     already tried; it frequently beats minimum-degree exactly on the small,
//!     irregular combinatorial/network graphs that dominate the tied `lt_1k` /
//!     `1k_10k` lists. It runs on an explicit dynamic elimination graph with an
//!     O(1) adjacency-membership matrix and a HARD pair-check work budget: on any
//!     input that would exceed the budget it cleanly finishes with a
//!     degree-ordered fill (still a valid bijection), so its time is bounded
//!     regardless of structure. Gated to `n < 3000 && nnz < 12000` — WAY below
//!     the slow tier (`nnz ≥ 163816`) — so it cannot move the worst case, and it
//!     allocates only the small `n·n` membership matrix (≤ 9 MB) it needs.
//!     Deterministic (fixed `(deficiency, degree, index)` tie-break). Best-of
//!     floor → zero-downside.
//!
//! ## Staying under the 2 s / SIGKILL cap — HARD cost envelopes
//!
//! The harness SIGKILLs `order()` at a hard 2 s per matrix and ONE breach FAILs
//! the whole run, so every candidate carries an explicit cost envelope in `(n,
//! nnz)`, sized from measurement (see the timing section above for why the old
//! "~0.35 s local ceiling" rule was unfounded).
//!
//! The two relabelled multi-starts are the exception, and deliberately so:
//! instead of an envelope they take a per-matrix time BUDGET,
//! `RELABEL_BUDGET / nnz` restarts. Because per-restart cost scales with nnz,
//! that bounds their added time on every matrix at once, and yields zero restarts
//! wherever `nnz > RELABEL_BUDGET`. The AMF arm carries a second, independent nnz
//! ceiling ([`RELABEL_AMF_MAX_NNZ`]) because its per-pass constant is larger.
//!
//! Worst combined `order()` measured at 0.439 s of the 2 s cap (0.384 s before the
//! AMF arm). NOTE: the 0.9-1.0 s figures elsewhere in this file were recorded on a
//! box roughly 2.5x slower; timings compare only within one box, so use the
//! comparative rule — stay at or below the worst case of a revision known to have
//! passed the grader, measured the same way on the same machine.
//!
//! The candidate set is a pure function of `(n, nnz)` — never wall-clock — so
//! the two required `order()` runs are byte-identical (determinism gate).
