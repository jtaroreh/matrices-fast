//! Randomized greedy elimination-game search on the EXACT objective `Σ c_j²`.
//!
//! ## Why this is a different family from the relabelled-AMD multi-start
//!
//! Every search family already in this module explores permutations by feeding
//! a *relabelled* pattern to `feral_amd`/`feral_amf` and re-scoring the result.
//! AMD is an *approximate* minimum-degree code: supervariables, aggressive
//! absorption, approximate external degrees, multiple elimination. Relabelling
//! only perturbs its internal tie-breaks, so the reachable set of orderings is a
//! narrow neighbourhood of "what AMD's approximations happen to produce".
//! `memory/experiments/0018` measured 3000 relabel seeds × 2 objectives on the
//! near-AMD mass and found essentially nothing — but explicitly flagged that it
//! is a *depth* result inside those two objectives, not a proof of optimality.
//!
//! This module searches a strictly larger space: the **exact** elimination game
//! with an arbitrary randomized pivot rule. No supervariables, no approximate
//! degree, no absorption — the true fill graph is maintained as bitsets and the
//! true external degree of every live vertex is known at every step.
//!
//! ## The objective is free
//!
//! In the elimination game, the column count charged when `v` is eliminated out
//! of the already-eliminated set `S` is exactly `c(v,S) = 1 + |N_{G_S}(v)|`
//! (the same identity `exact_dp.rs` is built on, and the same quantity
//! `column_counts_gnp` recovers from the permuted pattern). So a greedy run
//! *accumulates the scored objective as it goes*, at zero extra cost: there is
//! no separate scoring pass, and a partial sum that already exceeds the
//! incumbent lets the run be abandoned mid-flight (`Σ c²` is monotone in the
//! prefix). Both properties are what make tens of thousands of exact objective
//! evaluations affordable inside the per-matrix cap at `n < 1000`.
//!
//! ## Determinism
//!
//! Fixed-seed xorshift64, a fixed policy schedule, a fixed **operation** budget
//! (never wall-clock), and lowest-index tie-breaks everywhere a random draw is
//! not explicitly taken. Two runs on the same pattern return byte-identical
//! output, as the harness requires.

/// Re-order the inside of elimination-tree SUBTREES of a postordered incumbent.
///
/// ## Why a subtree is an exactly-separable subproblem
///
/// Let `S` be the vertex set of a subtree of the elimination tree of `perm`.
/// Two standard facts make the inside of `S` independently optimizable:
///
/// 1. `col_F(v)` — hence `c_v` — depends only on `v`'s DESCENDANTS in the etree
///    (Liu's reachable-set characterisation: `w ∈ col_F(v)` iff `w` is reachable
///    from `v` through vertices eliminated earlier, and those are exactly `v`'s
///    descendants). A subtree is closed under descendants, so for `v ∈ S` the
///    whole computation lives inside `S ∪ N_A(S)` and no vertex eliminated
///    before `S`'s block can touch it.
/// 2. The fill graph after eliminating a SET does not depend on the order
///    within the set. So everything ABOVE the subtree root — every `c_w` for
///    `w ∉ S` — is unchanged by any internal reordering.
///
/// Therefore `Σ_j c_j²` splits as `(fixed part) + Σ_{v∈S} c_v²`, and any
/// improvement found inside `S` is a global improvement of exactly the same
/// size. That is what makes this affordable on `gt_10k`: the search never sees
/// the whole matrix, only a block of a few hundred to a few thousand vertices
/// plus its boundary.
///
/// `perm` MUST be postordered with respect to its own elimination tree (which
/// leaves `Σ c_j²` unchanged), so that each subtree occupies a CONTIGUOUS range
/// of positions `[j - size(j) + 1, j]` — otherwise reordering inside `S` would
/// also move non-`S` vertices across `S`'s members and fact 1 would not apply.
///
/// Returns the number of blocks improved; `perm` is edited in place. The caller
/// must still re-score `perm` through the trusted scorer and keep it only on a
/// strict improvement.
